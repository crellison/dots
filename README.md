# My Dots

These are my dots.
There's a loose structure,
but everything is generally just tacked on as I need it.
I try to maintain some semantic separation of concerns.

## My Background

Much of my development involves writing Node and Python.
Services I work with are generally deployed in Kubernetes environments using Docker and Drone.
The more backend languages I have installed are largely there in a "so I have them" capacity.

## Before migrating off a machine

1. Update `Brewfile` with `brew bundle dump`

## Installation

The `.base_profile` expects a directory `dots` to exist in your `$HOME`.

1. Clone this repo to a direcotry `$HOME/dots`
1. Run the included initialization script `init.sh` 
(this *should* get all dependencies, but no promises there)
1. Source either `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.zshrc` based on your preferred shell flavor

## Use and permissions

Feel free to use any of this,
in whole or in part,
at your own risk.
Nothing should be dangerous,
but who knows.
